Title: "Love and Love Making: A Philosophical Guide in the Pursuit of Truth"
Location: Conference Hall
Date-Time: Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2 p.m.
Description: "Plato employs a variety of metaphors that invite his readers to think seriously about the relation of truth and sexuality.  We will examine what he has to say about this relation, and whether his contributions have any purchase for contemporary readers.  Is it helpful, in other words, to think about truth and sexuality in the way Plato hopes we will?  What is to be gained by encouraging readers to think closely about love and truth and sexuality?"
