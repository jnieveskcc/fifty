Title: "Civics Engagement in Action: KCC Launches the ILLinois Civics Academy for Teachers"
Location: Iroquois Room
Date-Time: Wednesday, Feb. 8, 6 p.m.
Description: "Join us to learn how we developed the Illinois Civics Academy for Teachers (ICAT)- a civics education program for high school educators statewide. Illinois returned civics education to the high school curriculum with legislation requiring all incoming high schoolers to complete one semester of civics education.  At the same time, the Illinois State Board of Education revised the two decades-old learning standards for high school social studies students to focus on community engagement and students’ civic literacy.  To rapidly respond to the need for professional development training for high school educators, KCC launched ICAT, a custom, three-day intensive professional development opportunity.  It was funded in part by the Robert R. McCormick Foundation. Developing the program strengthened community partnerships – one of KCC’s strategic goals – and demonstrated the Power of Community."
