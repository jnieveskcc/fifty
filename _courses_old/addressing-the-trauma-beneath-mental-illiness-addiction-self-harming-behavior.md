In this workshop you will learn strategies that will help you address five types of trauma which impact families, including: acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, complex trauma, 24-7-365 trauma, and historical trauma. We will discuss &quot;secrets theory&quot; and how workers can help decrease the impact of multi-generational trauma on families. Emphasis will also be placed on the use of humor and centering rituals to prevent secondary PTSD. Class notes: 6 contact hours awarded to nurses, counselors and social workers."
