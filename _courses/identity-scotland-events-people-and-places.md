Description: "This tour across the ages focuses
on the critical events, personalities
and location that helped
define Scotland and its place in
the 21st century. Starting from
ancient times, we’ll trace the
struggles of the Scottish people
to form alliances, create—and lose—a fragile level of independence
from their neighbors, and finally forge the will to
regain a measure of lost freedoms."
