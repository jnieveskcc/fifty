Course-No: LLLI 9750.A13
Instructor: Maureen Shannon
Location: Room D123
Date-Time: Wednesday, Oct  12, 10 a.m.-noon
Description: "Millions of mystery readers have enjoyed Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. But perhaps they don’t know about other fictional detectives such as Patricia Wentworth’s Miss Silver; Dorothy Sayer’s Lord Peter Whimsey; Ellis Peters’ Brother Cadfell; Rex Stout’s Nero Wolfe; Elizabeth Peters’ dynamic duo; and Amelia Peabody and her husband Radcliffe Emerson. And we must not forget Perry Mason and Ellery Queen. Class members will hear stories about some of these writers and how these books characterize life “way back when.” When you come to class, you are welcome to bring thoughts on other detectives from the 1920s through the 1960s for discussion."
