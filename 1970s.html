							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>For more than 40 years, dating back to 1972, KCC has been the physical agent and service provider for the federal CETA program (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act) and its later incarnations (Job Training Partnership Act, Workforce Investment Act and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The program offers up to $12,000 in monetary assistance to qualified participants who are training for the workforce. The WIOA offices are at KCC’s North Extension Center in Bourbonnais, in Morris at the Grundy Workforce Services Office and in Pontiac at the Livingston Workforce Services Office. In the photo, CETA workers in 197__ assist with planting trees. Today they are mature trees which grace the Riverfront Campus grounds.

Minimum qualifications for membership are completion of 12 semester hours of credit division coursework at KCC with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5. Members must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher. Phi Theta Kappa has recognized academic excellence in the two-year college since 1918.

The society offers opportunities for scholarships, intellectual enrichment, and personal development through programs based on the society’s hallmarks of scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship.</p>
								<p>One of the highest honors a KCC chapter member has earned was in 2007 when Stacey Snodgrass, chapter president during the 2005-06 academic years, was awarded the Hallmark Hall of Honor Outstanding President Award in recognition of her leadership and accomplishments while a student at KCC.</p>

While a student at KCC, LaMore also was a Phi Theta Kappa member.

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">Skylark sculpture dedicated</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>It was Illinois Arts week and days before KCC’s 10th Anniversary when Skylark—KCC’s first sculpture—was dedicated to the college’s first board of trustees: Ralph Francis, Mary Fraser, James Geist, Merlin Karlock, John Rooney, Kenneth Seebach & Kenneth Wiser. The $3,000 cost was funded through a bequest left to the college by William F. Brandenburg and the Illinois Arts Council. The artist, Alice Richheimer Culbert Wolk lived in Glencoe at the time the work was purchased. After being completed in 1977, the 8 foot, 6 inch tall "Skylark" was mounted in July, 1978. Made of corten steel, and weighing 800 pounds, Skylark was originally on KCC’s front lawn. It had at least one other roost before being moved in 2014 to be alongside the college’s main drive. At the dedication in 1978, Dr. Janet Heinicke, head of the visual arts program, described the piece: “The skylark bird is an appropriate educational symbol. In literature, the skylark is referred to as a soaring bird with distinct, if not loud, voice. Chaucer called it the messenger of the day. Elizabeth Barrett Browning noted 'soaring music within the soaring lark.' "In light of education, such images conjure thoughts of lofty, bold, clear and fresh ideas that prosper in educational institutions of a democracy and give us insight into ourselves and our world. Skylark, distinguished by its curves that give an impression of infinity, and its contrasting earthborn foundation, connotes two characteristics of the public community college. One, a continuum of thought and intellect reminiscent of the skylark bird and, two, an institution whose roots are firmly embedded in the land and the people of the land known as the community college district." Other notes from the day of dedication included this: “skylark--a bird of flight whose voice is a special cry and considered something beautiful. The sculpture’s abstract lines are infinite and open curves. Part of the educational process is not knowing where the end is--or it’s a never ending process. The result is not immediately visible. The sculpture’s bottom line is earth-bound. A public community college is very much related to its constituency. Urban and rural community are tied to the earth." The college now has three other permanent outdoor sculptures, Chicago Nike, Meridian IX, and Tin Man. The Arts and Culture site has more information about them, and about indoor sculpture at KCC.
