								<p>The KCC Student Association sponsors a Neil Diamond concert. Yes, Neil Diamond! It was at the Abraham Lincoln gymnasium (now Martin Luther King Jr. Gym, at King Middle Grade School) in Kankakee. A sell-out crowd got to see Diamond as his career was launching. His song Cracklin’ Rose was one week away from hitting no. 1 on the Billboard chart.</p>
								<p>Other Diamond hits which had already been on the charts by this date were <i>Solitary Man; Shilo; Sweet Caroline; Holly Holy; Cherry, Cherry; Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon; Kentucky Woman; I Got The Feelin' (Oh No No); </i>and <i>Red Red Wine</i>.</p>

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">KCC’s Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society Chapter is chartered</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>The <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/ptk">Alpha Delta Eta chapter</a> of the Phi Theta Kappa International Academic Honor Society is chartered at KCC. Hundreds of KCC students with outstanding academic achievements have been members. The club is stronger than ever today, and has achieved “five star status” the highest recognized level of activity, 13 times since 2001. The chapter and its members have earned numerous state and national awards for programs and service projects. One of the highest honors the KCC chapter attained was in 2015 being named one of the “100 Outstanding Chapters,” among 1,300. At graduation, Phi Theta Kappa members can wear a gold stole and tassel. Minimum qualifications for membership are completion of 12 semester hours of credit division coursework at KCC with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5. Members must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher. <a href="http://www.ptk.org/default.aspx">Phi Theta Kappa</a> has recognized academic excellence in the two-year college since 1918. It is the largest honor society in American higher education, with more than 1.5 million members. The society offers opportunities for scholarships, intellectual enrichment, and personal development through programs based on the society’s hallmarks of scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship.</p>
								<p>In 2013, KCC’s president, Dr. John Avendano, received the Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction to become one of just 22 college presidents and campus CEOs who received the honor that year.</p>
								<p>In 2014, an administrator from KCC, Susan LaMore, was selected to be the coordinator of the Illinois Region of Phi Theta Kappa. In the position, which she still holds, LaMore facilitates activities among the 57 chapters in Illinois. She also is the liaison between the national headquarters and individual chapters. While a student at KCC, LaMore also was a Phi Theta Kappa member.</p>

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">Skylark sculpture dedicated</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>It was Illinois Arts week and days before KCC’s 10th Anniversary when Skylark, KCC’s first sculpture, was dedicated to the college’s first board of trustees: Ralph Francis, Mary Fraser, James Geist, Merlin Karlock, John Rooney, Kenneth Seebach &amp; Kenneth Wiser. The $3,000 cost was funded through a bequest left to the college by William F. Brandenburg and the Illinois Arts Council. The artist, Alice Richheimer Culbert Wolk lived in Glencoe at the time the work was purchased. After being completed in 1977, the 8 foot, 6 inch tall "Skylark" was mounted in July, 1978. Made of corten steel, and weighing 800 pounds, Skylark was originally on KCC’s front lawn. It had at least one other roost before being moved in 2014 to be alongside the college’s main drive.</p>
								<p>At the dedication in 1978, Dr. Janet Heinicke, head of the visual arts program, described the piece: “The skylark bird is an appropriate educational symbol. In literature, the skylark is referred to as a soaring bird with distinct, if not loud, voice. Chaucer called it the messenger of the day. Elizabeth Barrett Browning noted 'soaring music within the soaring lark.' "In light of education, such images conjure thoughts of lofty, bold, clear and fresh ideas that prosper in educational institutions of a democracy and give us insight into ourselves and our world. Skylark, distinguished by its curves that give an impression of infinity, and its contrasting earthborn foundation, connotes two characteristics of the public community college. One, a continuum of thought and intellect reminiscent of the skylark bird and, two, an institution whose roots are firmly embedded in the land and the people of the land known as the community college district.”</p>
								<p>Other notes from the day of dedication included this: skylark&mdash;a bird of flight whose voice is a special cry and considered something beautiful. The sculpture’s abstract lines are infinite and open curves. Part of the educational process is not knowing where the end is&mdash;or it’s a never ending process. The result is not immediately visible. The sculpture’s bottom line is earth-bound. A public community college is very much related to its constituency. Urban and rural community are tied to the earth."</p>
								<p>The college now has three other permanent outdoor sculptures, Chicago Nike, Meridian IX, and Tin Man. The <a href="http://www.kcc.edu/Community/arts/Pages/default.aspx">Arts and Culture site</a> has more information about them, and about indoor sculpture at KCC.</p>
