							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>In a competition open to welders around the world, a team from KCC won first place during “Welding Wars,” in Chicago during the FabTech convention.

We ended up being the fastest team. Everything just flowed together.”</p>								<p>“We had a lot of pictures and interviews (after winning),” Harris said. “We were treated like movie stars for about an hour.” </p>								<p>For finishing first, Harris, Raetz and Anderson each received a new Tweco multi-process welder, valued at about $2,000, plus other prizes.</p>								<p>“During the competition, we were really calm … having fun like we normally would,” Anderson said. “We went up against some other good colleges. The college that finished second is pretty ‘big-time’ in welding. And we beat them. I thought that was pretty amazing.”</p>							</div>
