							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">The college is established</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>Maybe the announcement read “It’s a College!” This is the day when the college which would later be named Kankakee Community College is officially established. Citizens of 10 area high school districts voted to create a Class I Junior College in Kankakee, Illinois. The election provided for an 18 cent tax rate for operational expenses for the college. The college got its name a year later, in October 1967.

							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>A little more than 18 months after it was established, the first three instructors were hired by the college. The board of trustees appointed: Glenn Isaacs of DeKalb to be physical education director and head basketball coach; William B. Sanders of San Francisco, sociology; and Charles A. Swannell of Bedford, Ind., English.

							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>Steps toward welcoming students are continuing. In 1967, 177 acres of land were purchased to be the site of the new college. The college property was purchased from the state for a total cost of $395,000, or $2,231 per acre, which was determined by impartial appraisers. The state paid the majority of the cost, making much of the deal a transfer of land. The actual local cost was $98,750. The transfer of land required the signature of Gov. Otto Kerner. (Source: Kankakee Daily Journal, July 18, 1967)</p>								<p>The following May, a groundbreaking is held to construct six temporary barrack-type, aluminum-framed buildings on the campus. The buildings will be west of the location planned for the permanent buildings. Although planned to be temporary, the West Campus buildings served the college well, and took on a number of uses. Most of them lasted. Four of them are still in use, as renewable energy labs, for the Horticulture Program, the Northeastern Illinois Area Agency on Aging and for KCC storage.</p>								<p>Phase I of construction of the permanent facility was completed in 1972. Phase II was finished a year later. Between them, they include a three-story main building, two-story vocational building, more than 60 classrooms and laboratories, a bookstore, college center, auditorium, offices and library (then called “Learning Resource Center”).</p>

							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>It’s official: the college is a hit. When the doors opened, 198 students were enrolled in 30 credit classes. The continuing education area had a few more people, with 263 students registered for 94 adult continuing education classes. The college had an original faculty team of 13 instructors.</p>

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">KCC Foundation established</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>The Board of Trustees passed a resolution establishing the KCC Foundation to provide financial and other support for the college and its activities. It is established as the sole official fund raising and private gift-receiving agency for the college. The first donation was $60, and it was made by Donald Zeglis, who served as KCC’s legal counsel.</p>
								<p>For the last 47 years, the Foundation has managed the distribution of scholarship awards, assisted with the establishment of gifts and administered planned giving programs through trusts and wills. Today, more than $200,000 in scholarships is awarded to KCC students annually and the Foundation’s current assets are $5.6 million.</p>
								<p>The Foundation funds scholarships and grants to assist students. They also support student clubs and fund some college equipment purchases. Through gifts from KCC employees, the Foundation also provides some student success initiatives.</p>
