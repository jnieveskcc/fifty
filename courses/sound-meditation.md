Title: Sound Meditation
Location: Iroquois Room
Date-Time: Wednesday, Nov. 9, 6-8 p.m.
Description: "In this very calming and relaxing class, we will begin with very simple stretching to prepare for meditation. We begin with simple, gentle movements from Qigong, the ancient Chinese health care and maintenance system. The Form we will practice is an Elemental Energy Form which concludes with the “Healing Sounds” practice, followed by very deep relaxation. Come join us as the healing tones of brass and crystal singing bowls, mellow gongs, and bells bathe you in healing meditational vibration. Together, we will reach deep states of relaxation and meditation. You’ll leave feeling “re-tuned”, restored and rebalanced."
Instructor: Gary Paruszkiewicz
