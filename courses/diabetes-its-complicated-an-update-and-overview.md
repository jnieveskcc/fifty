Title: "Diabetes&mdash;it's Complicated. An Update and Overview"
Location: Iroquois Room
Date-Time: Friday, Oct. 28, 8:30 a.m.-4 p.m.
Description: "Everything you have always wanted to know about diabetes&mdash;and then some because there's LOTS of new information since the last time you heard a diabetes lecture!! Join Barb Bancroft for an entire day on Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Barb will give you the current thinking on the pathophysiology of both Type 1 and Type 2. Instead of the old &quot;triad&quot; of problems in type 2 diabetes, we now have the &quot;ominous eight&quot; underlying problems!  The clinical manifestations will be correlated with the pathophysiology, as will the various classes of drugs used to treat the underlying insulin deficiency and/or insulin resistance. Barb will also discuss the complications of this disease&mdash;including microvascular and macrovascular complications involving all body systems. Lab tests will also be described&mdash;when to do them and how to interpret the results. Therapeutic lifestyle changes will be emphasized for both the prevention and the treatment of the disease.
Class note: 5 contact hours awarded to Illinois licensed nurses, nursing home administrators, occupational therapists, and counselors."
