Title: Humor in Counseling
Course-No: LECT 8760.A13
Instructor: Mark Sanders
Location: Iroquois Room
Date-Time: Friday, Sept. 23, 9 a.m.-noon
Description: "When Norman Cousins was suffering from a debilitating illness of his immune system, doctors predicted that he would not live a long life. In pain twenty-four hours a day, Cousins discovered that for every ten minutes he laughed, he experienced two hours of pain-free sleep. He actually lived sixteen years longer than his doctors predicted. Participants will leave this workshop with tools that will enable them to incorporate more humor into their work with clients. The second part of this workshop will focus on the use of humor and other strategies to decrease counselor stress, burnout, compassion fatigue, and improve overall organizational health. This promises to be a fun learning experience."
