description: The beers of BrickStone Brewpub & Restaurant have earned numerous top awards, including a gold medal for the Dark Secret Russian Imperial Stout at this yearâ€™s Beverage Testing Institute World Beer Championships. Since opening in 2006, the popularity of their various brews has grown and expansion has followed. The brewery started with a five barrel capacity. It now has a state-of the-art brew house with capacity for 25 barrels. A fully automated 50 barrel brew house with canning capabilities is close to completion. This course will offer an overview of the process used in brewing and a tour of the new BrickStone facility to better understand the steps used in production and sampling of craft beers.
