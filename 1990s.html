							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">New KCC logo is adopted</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p> KCC adopts a new college logo, with an abstract K and two abstract Cs. The logo used the college colors (blue and scarlet), is contemporary and intended to convey a feeling of forward movement and vitality. The logo was designed by Drew Denoyer.</p>
								<p>The logo undergoes a makeover for the College's 25th anniversary. The 25th anniversary is then adapted. It is used for the next 15 years. On the occasion of the college's 40th anniversary, a new “40th anniversary” logo is adopted. Following the 40th anniversary year, the “40” is dropped.</p>
								<p>Now that the college is celebrating 50 years, a 50th anniversary version has been created. It uses the college blue, plus gold.</p>

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">25th anniversary</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>Nearly 5,000 people turned out to celebrate KCC's 25th anniversary. The school has grown from a few temporary buildings to a sprawling 223,000-square-foot red-brick campus with more than 4,000 students. The celebration includes slime-making demonstrations, an aerobics marathon, performances by three high school choirs, a Karaoke contest, and a frozen yogurt served – of course – in the air-conditioning lab. The day was also a chance to showcase a newly-restored 1966 Ford Mustang convertible which was being raffled by the KCC Foundation to raise scholarship funds. Tickets were $100 each, and only 500 were available. Before the winner was drawn in July 1992, the car won a number of trophies in local auto shows.</p>								<p>Board of Trustee members during the 25th anniversary celebration were: Fey Orr, Betty Meents, Charles C. Huber, Donald L. Haley, Dr. Walter D. Maddox, Hugh E. Van Voorst and Dennis Smith. Fey Orr was the board chair at the time. Hugh Van Voorst would go on to be the board chair from 1995 to 2014. Another person on the board, Betty Meents, was the longest serving trustee at 39 years, from April 1976 to January 2015.</p>							</div>

							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>The Northern Illinois Anglers Association and KCC dedicated a new environmental and natural history library collection to honor Kankakee River advocate Gordon Graves. The collection was added at the KCC Learning Resource Center (now the Miner Memorial Library). The following December, a significant addition was made thanks to Graves' friend, R. Ben Peyton and staff in the department of Fisheries and Wildlife of Michigan State University. The collection remains, and continues to have a very appropriate home given the college's proximity to the Kankakee River.</p>

								<p>The Cavalier's volleyball team finished in second place at the NJCAA National Tournament after winning the regional IV title. All-Americans Kelly Gardner and Jenny Wobrock assisted in setting a team record of 38 wins in a row. Despite 12 region titles, it is the closest the volleyball team has come to a national title. The KCC men’s basketball team has also been the national runner-up twice, in 1985 and 1988. The baseball team has been close, too, with a third place finish in the NJCAA World Series in 2009.</p>

								<p>KCC held its first-ever job fair at the college with representatives of 25 businesses on hand to accept resumes, give out applications or give short interviews. More than 300 current and past students were able to meet with representatives from area businesses. It gave employers and students a chance to receive more information about each other.</p>
								<p>There has been at least one job fair per year since. Currently, the college has two, a spring job fair in early April each year, and a fall fair, each year in early October. Typically, at least 40 employers and hundreds of community members attend each event.</p>

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">Women's basketball team wins national tourney</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>It was a triple-overtime thriller! KCC needed to come from behind to prevail. With 15 seconds left in the second half, KCC was behind by 3, 66-69. In the end, after three overtimes had passed, KCC triumphed with a 94-89 victory over St. Clair (Michigan) Community College. KCC’s first-ever national championship in athletics was won on a Saturday night in Hagerstown, Md.</p>								<p>The Cavs' team leader was Amy Kieckbusch, who was named tournament MVP, and who also was an NJCAA First-Team All-American. The KCC women's basketball team won the NJCAA national tournament under the direction of Coach Paul O'Connor. The team ended the season with 34 wins and 2 losses. On the 20th anniversary of the championship, all 12 players returned to KCC for a reunion.</p>								<p>It is a little-known fact that O'Connor was the first coach of a women's team at KCC. It wasn't basketball, though, it was softball. One more tidbit: With 20 visits, KCC's women's basketball team has more appearances at the Division II NJCAA tournament than any other team.</p>							</div>

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">High school students can earn college credit with new program</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>KCC is offering a new summer program, "Honors Credit in Escrow." It is designed for area high school students to begin attending KCC between their junior and senior years. They can then complete a full semester of college classes before others even begin college the fall semester after high school graduation. Perks of the program include saving money compared to the cost of a university. Requirements are an ACT grade of 22 or above, a grade point average of 2.5 or better and rank in the top 20 percent of his or her class.</p>								<p>Today, area high school students have a number of options to earn college credit before graduating. High school-age students 16 can enroll at KCC and bank the credits for KCC or to transfer to another college. Some work at the Kankakee Area Career Center as well as 12 area high schools can be used as equivalent to select KCC classes through the Dual Credit option. And, in 2011, KCC started the Early College Program where qualified high school seniors can attend KCC for a full year. They earn a year’s worth of college credit and finish high school at the same time.</p>							</div>

							<h2 class="timeline-event__title">Instructor roars ahead at Indy 500</h2>
							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>KCC instructor Art Suprenant has worked at the Indianapolis 500 for three years and returned again to weld at Gasoline Alley, the one location for all welding work at the Indy 500. By working at the race, Suprenant makes contacts that become learning and growth opportunities for KCC welding students and the college. One example is that plans are underway for KCC to become the official training center for the National Automotive Radiator Services Association. Suprenant uses the most advanced welding materials and equipment available while working at the Indy 500. He returns that knowledge to KCC to keep its program in tune with current trends.</p>								<p>Suprenant continues to work at the Indy 500 each year. For the race’s 100th running on May 29, 2016, Suprenant worked for Ed Carpenter Racing's drivers, Josef Newgarden, J R Hildebrand, and Ed Carpenter. Over the years, at the 500, he has worked both in the welding garage and on pit crews whose drivers included Claude Bourbonnais, Sarah Fisher, Al Unser Jr., Buddy Lazier, and Robbie Buhl. Additionally, for many years, he was a team member and worked race weekends in California, Texas, Alabama, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maryland, and Florida. From as far away as Japan, to neighboring Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, on race day, his duties included donning a fire suit and helping to refuel the car during pit stops.</p>								<p>Suprenant taught and was a program coordinator at KCC from 1970 to 2002, and he received the KCC Alumni Association Recognition Award in 1997.</p>							</div>

							<div class="timeline-event__description">
								<p>Enhanced college services for low-income, first-generation and disabled college students will be the focus of the new federally-funded TRIO Student Support Services program. The services, which begin in Spring 1998, are intended to offer students who face barriers in earning a college degree the extra support they need to complete their education. More specific goals include to increase participants' retention and graduation rates, facilitate their transfer to four-year colleges and universities and foster success.</p>								<p>The TRIO grant awards $800,000 per year from the U.S. Department of Education during its first four years. To qualify for TRIO services, neither of the student's parents may have earned a bachelor’s degree, or the student must meet federal income guidelines, or the student must have a documented disability.</p>								<p>The TRIO grant has been renewed a number of times, and to date, 150 students per year are assisted. Every spring, since 1999, the program has given out “STAR Awards” &mdash; the Spectacular TRIO Award of Recognition. STAR recipients must each have a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 or higher and have completed at least 12 credit hours of course work during the current year. In Spring 2016, 32 TRIO students earned the STAR award. Each STAR student gets to honor a faculty or staff member who has contributed to their success.</p>							</div>
